# Microhack: AKS CI/CD using GitHub Actions
A microhack to learn more about the CI/CD process for AKS using Github Actions.

This microhack consists of 5 steps:
1. Setup the required infrastructure
2. Update a raw Kubernetes deployment (CD only)
3. Update an Helm chart (CD only)
4. Build an image and update a Helm chart (CI and CD)
5. Build an image and do a blue/green deployment (CI and CD)

Each step is contained in a folder, with the required explanation. 

It is recommended to fork this repository, and then iteratively build your own GitHub actions.
